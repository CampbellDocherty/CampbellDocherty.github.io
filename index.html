			 Last summer I graduted from King's College London with a degree in Philosophy, having
			 taken classes in film and photography too (below I have included some of the photos I have taken). 
			 More recently I have developed an interest in coding 
			 and I am considering a career in web development. Founders and Coders can provide a platform from 
			 which to achieve this goal. Specifically, I am attracted to Founders and Coders for two main reasons. 
			 The programme’s focus on socially beneficial web apps is particularly appealing. The power of coding 
			 to galvanise social welfare projects is key to a fair distribution of tech resources. There has
			 to be initiatives like Founders and Coders that can provide coding skills in a space dedicated to 
			 ‘tech for better’. This ethos of learning to give back, serves to represent all the positive aspects 
			 that I have discovered in the coding community over the last few months - free online resources and a 
			 community willing to provide guidance on countless forums. I am excited at the prospect of 
			 working on socially beneficial web apps and mentoring the next cohort of students. More 
			 personally, the peer-led learning process at Founders and Coders aligns with the way that I 
			 prefer to learn. Throughout the course of the prerequisites when I encountered difficulties 
			 and had exhausted other methods of research, I would turn to friends who were more advanced 
			 at coding. Having someone in person to guide me through problems was the way in which I truly 
			 started to grasp the underlying mechanisms of JavaScript. I think I would be a good fit for 
			 Founders and Coders in this regard as well.
